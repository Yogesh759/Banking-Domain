# Banking-Domain-Analysis
🔹 Project Description
An interactive banking risk analytics dashboard built using Power BI to help banks make data-driven lending decisions, visualize key financial KPIs, and reduce lending risks.

This project clearly uses the STAR method to explain its workflow for better understanding during interviews, portfolio reviews, or GitHub exploration.

✅ Situation
Banks need to assess customer profiles to decide on loan approvals while minimizing risk. Manual assessment can lead to inconsistencies and financial loss if high-risk applicants are approved.

✅ Task
Build a Power BI dashboard to:

Analyze customer profiles for lending risk

Visualize key metrics like loans, deposits, client segmentation

Empower banks to make data-backed loan decisions

✅ Action
Using Power BI and provided datasets:

Data Cleaning:

Added Engagement Timeframe and Engagement Days

Created income bands and processing fee columns for clarity

Data Modeling:

Linked tables (Client-Banking, Banking Relationship, Gender, etc.) via keys

DAX Measures:

Built measures for Total Clients, Loans, Deposits, Fees, and account-specific amounts

Used SUM, SUMX, DISTINCTCOUNT, DATEDIFF, and SWITCH for accurate metrics

Dashboard Building:

Created four clean, interactive dashboards:

Home Page: High-level overview

Loan Analysis: In-depth loan analysis by customer and segment

Deposit Analysis: Detailed deposit analysis by type and segment

Summary Dashboard: Consolidated view for quick insights

Added slicers for Gender, Banking Relationship, Year, and Institution Advisor for easy filtering

✅ Result
The Power BI dashboards:

Provide clear insights into customer profiles

Help banks identify repayment likelihood before approving loans

Reveal which nationality, gender, and client segments have the highest loan and deposit trends

Allow stakeholders to make fast, data-driven decisions

The dashboards are scalable for future predictive analytics, automated reporting, and client-level deep dives.
